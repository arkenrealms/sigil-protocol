# arken/packages/sigil-protocol/util

Shared schema helpers for Sigil protocol routers.

## Notes
- `getQueryInput` accepts both `take` and `limit` pagination keys.
- Prefer `take` for Prisma-style callers; keep `limit` for compatibility.
- When only `limit` is provided, parsing now mirrors it into `take` for downstream Prisma-style consumers.
- When only `take` is provided, parsing mirrors it into `limit` to preserve legacy callers that still read `limit`.
- If both `take` and `limit` are provided but differ, `take` is treated as canonical and `limit` is normalized to match.
- Pagination fields (`skip`/`take`/`limit`) are validated as non-negative integers to prevent invalid downstream query envelopes.
- `createPrismaWhereSchema` logical operators (`AND`/`OR`/`NOT`) accept either a single where object or a non-empty array.
- Exported `Query` now mirrors that behavior: logical operators accept either a single where object or a non-empty array.
- Field-level `not` filters accept both scalar shorthand values and nested operator objects (Prisma-compatible), e.g. `{ name: { not: { contains: 'foo' } } }`.
- Scalar shorthand now correctly preserves non-plain object values (for example `Date`) by mapping them to `{ equals: value }` instead of treating them like operator envelopes.
- String-filter `mode` is constrained to Prisma-compatible values (`default` | `insensitive`) to reject unsupported options early.
- String-only operators (`contains` / `startsWith` / `endsWith` / `mode`) are now only accepted on string fields to fail fast before invalid Prisma query construction on numeric/date fields.
- Optional/nullable/default-wrapped string fields are unwrapped before filter generation, so valid string operators continue to work on fields like `z.string().optional()`.
- `orderBy` accepts both a single object and Prisma-style arrays of objects (e.g. `[{ level: 'desc' }, { name: 'asc' }]`).
- `orderBy` directions are normalized with trim + lowercase in both `Query` and `getQueryInput`, so `ASC`/`DESC` and padded variants are accepted.
- `orderBy` now rejects empty objects (`{}`) to prevent no-op/ambiguous sort envelopes.
- `orderBy` now also rejects empty arrays (`[]`) so callers must provide at least one concrete sort clause when using array form.
- `orderBy` now rejects blank/whitespace field keys (for example `{ "": "asc" }`) to prevent invalid sort envelopes from reaching Prisma.
- `include`/`select` now reject blank/whitespace field keys (for example `{ " ": true }`) so invalid projection envelopes fail fast during schema parsing.
- `include`/`select` now reject empty objects (`{}`) so projection envelopes always include at least one explicit field.
- `orderBy`/`include`/`select` now also reject reserved prototype keys (`__proto__`, `prototype`, `constructor`) to avoid passing prototype-pollution-shaped payloads into downstream query processing.
- `cursor` now uses the same non-empty + safe-key guards as `orderBy`/`include`/`select`, rejecting blank/reserved keys and empty envelopes before resolver/database pagination handling.
